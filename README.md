# Cursor Landing Page Clone

This project is a frontend clone of the Cursor landing page built using pure HTML and CSS.

The objective was to accurately recreate the visual layout, typography, spacing, and design hierarchy of the original website while maintaining a structured and maintainable CSS architecture.

## 📌 Sections Recreated

The following sections were recreated:

- Navigation Bar  
- Hero Section  
- Feature Sections  
- Autonomous Section  
- Join Us Section  
- Try Cursor Section  
- Footer  

The desktop layout closely matches the original design in spacing, alignment, and typography.

## 🎨 Design System

The project uses a centralized CSS variable system defined in `:root` for consistency and maintainability.

### Font System

Primary font stack:

CursorGothic, 'CursorGothic Fallback', system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif


All typography is built on this base font configuration to maintain visual consistency.

### Color System

The UI follows a structured dark theme:

- **Primary Background:** `#14120b`
- **Secondary Background:** `rgb(27, 25, 19)`
- **Tertiary Background:** `rgb(28, 36, 30)`

- **Primary Text:** `rgb(237, 236, 236)`
- **Muted Text:** `rgba(237, 236, 236, 0.6)`

- **Accent Color:** `rgb(245, 78, 0)`
- **Accent Hover:** `rgb(214, 64, 0)`

A consistent full-radius system (`9999px`) is used for rounded elements such as buttons.
